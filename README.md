# Epic NFT contract

Epic NFT is a website that connects to its smart contract and lets you create epic NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.

This repository only contains the smart contract and it is deployed on the Goerli testnet.

The contract will create 3 different SVG shapes with various random colors.

Every address will have the chance to mint their own NFTs but it will have a maximum amount that will be specified by the web3 app that calls the `makeAnEpicNFT` function.

A cooldown timer of 1 minute is set after each minting process.
